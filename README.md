## Divide and Conquer

The **_Divide and Conquer_** paradigm is a powerful strategy for algorithm design that involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them recursively, and combining the results.

Here are the key algorithms and concepts covered:

* **_Master Theorem_**: Provides a formula to quickly determine the time complexity of recursive, divide-and-conquer algorithms.
* **_Exponentiation by Squaring_**: An efficient algorithm that computes large integer powers in logarithmic time.
* **_Merge Sort_**: A stable sorting algorithm that sorts an array by recursively splitting it in half and merging the sorted subarrays.
* **_Quick Sort_**: An efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot element and sorts the partitions recursively.
* **_Quickselect_**: A selection algorithm that finds the k-th smallest element in a collection in expected linear time.
* **_Maximum Subarray Sum_**: An optimized divide-and-conquer approach to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in linear time.
* **_Karatsuba's Algorithm_**: A fast multiplication algorithm that improves upon the classic method by reducing the number of recursive multiplications.
* **_Closest Pair of Points_**: A geometric algorithm that efficiently finds the two points with the minimum distance between them in a plane.
